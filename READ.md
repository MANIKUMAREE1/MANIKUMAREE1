# Basic Image Editor (Image Processing-EE610)
This repo contains code of basic Image editor to perform various task on an image such as Histogram equalization, Laplacian sharpening, Gamma transformation, Logarithmic transformations, Sobel operation ,Gaussian blur . The code is implemented in python also an GUI(Graphical User Interface ) is made which is also implemented in python using Tkinter Framework. An IEEE standard report in .pdf format is also included which explains each and every operation in detailed manner.
